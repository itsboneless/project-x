**Media Design Internship Portfolio Website**

This is my personal portfolio website created to present my skills, creative projects, and growth as a media design student. It’s designed for internship applications, showcasing both technical proficiency and design thinking. The website highlights individual and group projects, demonstrates problem-solving approaches, and shares my passion for creating functional, thoughtful, and visually engaging designs.

## 2. Background

As a 7th-semester media design student, I needed a professional platform to support my search for an internship. I started by building upon an older portfolio version, aiming to update it with new projects, better design layouts, and improved technical features. Throughout the development process, I encountered and overcame significant challenges, including restructuring the website for modern deployment environments, which further strengthened my web development skills.

## 3. Learning & Tools Applied

During this project, I enhanced and applied the following skills and tools:

- **Popup Modals** – Designed and implemented custom popups to display detailed project information based on my own UI/UX design ideas.
- **CSS Grids and Flexbox** – Combined both layout techniques for flexible and responsive design.
- **Fancybox Integration** – Enabled effective viewing of posters, videos, and PDF files.
- **Multi-Page Deployment with Vite** – Researched and applied a correct structure for hosting multi-page sites using Vite.
- **Website Optimization** – Reduced image sizes, added lazy loading and preloading for better performance.
- **Domain Purchase & Configuration** – Bought and configured a personal domain.

## 4. Technology Stack

Key technologies used:

- **HTML5 & CSS3** – For structure and styling.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – To build interactivity and improve my core understanding of JavaScript.
- **Vite** – Recommended by my teachers (Kraftwerk minor) for efficient modern development.
- **Fancybox** – For displaying media like videos, posters, and PDFs.
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control.
- **Vercel** – For quick and easy deployment.

## 5. Installation & Usage

To run the project locally:
```
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Cd project-x
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
```
## 6. Why These Tools?

- **Vanilla JavaScript** – Chosen to strengthen my core coding skills and prepare for learning frameworks in the future.
- **Vite** – Recommended by teachers for faster development workflow and better support for modern web standards.
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** – Used together to achieve responsive and flexible layouts depending on the design requirements.
- **Custom Modals** – Developed based on my own design concepts to practice implementing UI ideas.
- **Fancybox** – Provided a simple solution for media viewing without building a custom solution from scratch.
- **Vercel** – Selected for its simplicity and smooth deployment process, especially for Vite projects.

## 7. Purpose & Next Steps

The portfolio website now:

- Provides a clear, professional presentation of my skills and growth.
- Serves as a key tool for internship applications.
- Demonstrates not only final project results but also my design process, problem-solving, and adaptability.
- Offers a responsive and engaging user experience.

**Next steps** include regularly updating the portfolio with new projects and continuing to refine both the design and technical performance as I grow in my media design career.
